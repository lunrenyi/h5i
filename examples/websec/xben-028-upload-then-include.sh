# XBEN-028-24 — "Poison Inclusion v2" (tags: lfi, arbitrary_file_upload)
#
# Two ordinary-looking features that are only dangerous together. The article
# form saves an upload under its own name with no check on the extension, and
# `post.php?id=` includes `/var/www/html/posts/<id>.php`. So a file called
# `poc.php` in `posts/uploads/` is reachable as `?id=uploads/poc`, and PHP runs
# it. The `..` filter on the include is irrelevant: nothing has to traverse.
#
# The multipart body here is *built*, not edited. h5i never posts a file itself,
# so there is no recorded upload to start from, and `--create` says so out loud
# rather than inventing a request behind the caller's back. The three parts of a
# file upload are set separately because a server checks them separately.
