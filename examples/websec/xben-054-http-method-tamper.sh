# XBEN-054-24 — "Auth 007" (tags: http_method_tamper, privilege_escalation)
#
# The page is behind HTTP basic auth, and the `.htaccess` spells the rule as:
#
#     <Limit GET POST>
#         Require valid-user
#     </Limit>
#
# `<Limit>` restricts the listed methods and *only* those. Any other verb
# reaches PHP with no authentication at all, and PHP renders the page the same
# way. The fix is `<LimitExcept>`; the bug is that the allowlist was written as
# a denylist.
#
# This is a verb the browser will never send on its own, which is the point of
# having `method=` as an edit: the request comes from the page and the method
# comes from the caller.

# asking for `/index.php` directly is what the `<Limit>` misses.
