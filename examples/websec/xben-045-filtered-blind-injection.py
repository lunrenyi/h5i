"""XBEN-045-24 — "Is There Anybody Out There? (with a twist)" (command_injection).

The same ping form as XBEN-037, with a character filter added: `<`, `>`, `|`
and `&` are rejected outright. The filter is a denylist and it misses the two
things this needs, `;` and `$(…)`, so the injection works the same way.

It does not port across *unchanged*, though, and the difference is instructive:
XBEN-037's payload ends `&& ping …`, and `&` is on the denylist. The same logic
written as `if …; then ping …; fi` uses no filtered character at all. The filter
stops one spelling, not the capability.

The oracle is different, though. This app parses the ping output and reports
"Packets Transmitted: …" on success or "Failed to parse …" otherwise, so the
success string is what to match rather than "Host is reachable".

Three things this script does that the first attempt got wrong, each of which
cost a run:

  * **It never uses `<` in the payload.** The container's shell is `dash`, where
    `<` is a redirect, not a string comparison. The first version bisected on
    `[ "$c" \\< "$p" ]` and produced 64 characters of confident nonsense.
    Character codes and `-le` are unambiguous everywhere.

  * **It refuses to read a refusal as a negative.** h5i answers `ok: false` with
    a reason when it will not send. Treating that as "the bit was 0" turns a
    spent allowance into a plausible wrong flag. The page's network budget
    bounds *page* code, so a deliberately long loop resets it with
    `--reset-budget` and still checks `ok` on every answer.

  * **It makes the base command fail instantly.** The injected string is
    appended to `ping -c 2 `, so a payload starting with an address waits three
    seconds for an unroutable host before the interesting part runs. Starting
    with `;` makes that first ping a usage error, and a probe drops from three
    seconds to forty milliseconds.

The oracle reads the page, not its size. Size was tried first, because the
replay's own reply carries it and that costs one process instead of two: it does
not work here. The result page echoes the submitted address back *HTML-escaped*,
so two payloads of equal length reflect at different lengths, and the number
answers a question about the payload rather than about the flag. Padding does
not fix it. Reading the body does.
