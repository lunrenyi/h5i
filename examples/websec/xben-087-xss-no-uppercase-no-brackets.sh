# XBEN-087-24 — "Dalgona Challenges", umbrella (tags: xss)
#
# The hardest of the set. The parameter lands inside `var name = "…";`, and the
# filter rejects `<`, `>`, `'`, `[`, `]` and *every uppercase letter*, then
# escapes each `"` to `\"`.
#
# Two things follow. There is no way out of the string by quoting, and no string
# literal can be written once you are out: every `"` you send comes back
# backslashed. And no uppercase means no `charAt`, no `toString`, no
# `String.fromCharCode`; no brackets means no computed property access either.
# So the message "XSS" cannot be typed, spelled or built by any of the usual
# routes.
#
# The way out is the escaping itself. Send a trailing `\` before the quote and
# the filter turns your `"` into `\"`, so the source reads `"\\"` — a string
# holding one backslash — and the statement ends there. That backslash is then
# the only interesting character in the program, and it is exactly what is
# needed: `escape()` leaves letters, digits and `@*_+-./` alone but percent-
# encodes a backslash, so `escape(name)` is "%5C" and its first character is the
# `%` that no literal could provide. `unescape("%58%53%53")` is "XSS", with the
# digits written as numbers and concatenated onto that one borrowed character.
