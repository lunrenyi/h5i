# `redirect.php?url=` hands whatever it is given to `file_get_contents` and
# prints the result. The compose file puts a second service on the same network
# with no port published, reachable only from inside: `http://internal-service/`
# resolves for the app and for nothing outside it. The app fetches it for us.
#
# Worth noting what h5i records here. The session's own request went to the
# published port; the *internal* fetch was made by the application and appears
# nowhere in h5i's receipts, because h5i did not make it. The receipts describe
# what this browser reached, not what the target reached on its behalf, and
# conflating the two would make the log a guess.
