# Two things in this corpus stop it from running on a current Docker and on

#
#   * `mysql:5.7` and `mongo` were never published for arm64. Docker runs them
#     under emulation, per *service*: forcing the whole project to amd64 makes
#     the application image build under qemu too, where building PHP extensions
#     segfaults.
#   * Several files write `expose: [3306:3306]`. `expose` takes a bare container
#     port; that form is a mapping. Older compose tolerated it and current
#     Docker refuses the whole project with "invalid port".
#
# A *rewritten* file rather than an override, because compose merges list
# fields by appending: an override cannot remove the entry that breaks it.
